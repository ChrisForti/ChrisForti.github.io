    <p>"Carefully watch your thoughts, for they become your words. Manage and watch your words, for they will become your actions. Consider and judge 
      your actions, for they have become your habits. Acknowledge and watch your habits, for they shall become your values. Understand and embrace 
      your values, for they become your destiny." ~ Mahatma Gandhi

    <p>O cosmic berther of all radiance and vibration.
      Soften the ground of our being, and carve out within us a space were your presence can abide.
      Fill us with your creativity so that we may be empowered 
      To bare the fruit of your mission.
      Let each of our actions bare fruit in accordance to our desires.
      Endow us with wisdom to produce and share what each being needs to grow and flourish.
      Untie the tangled threads of destiny that bind us.
      As we release others of the entanglment of past mistakes.
      Do not let us be seduced by that which will divert us from our true purpose.
      But illuminate the opportunitites of the present moment.
      For you are the ground, and the fruitfull vision.
      The birth the power, and fullfilment
      As all is gathered and made whole once again
      And so it is!?/bin/bash
