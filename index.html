    <p>After spending over 20 years as a boatbuilder honing my craft of designing and constructing seaworthy vessels, I've embarked on an exciting career shift into the world of devops. Though worlds apart, I've found that many of the same principles that lead to high-quality boats - continuous improvement, automation, and modular architectures - also enable scaling and resilience in complex software systems. My journey from physical to digital construction has been fueled by a passion for optimization and capability building. Just as I iterated wooden hull designs and experimented with techniques to improve structural integrity, I now apply that hands-on drive to infrastructures and deployment pipelines. I may have traded saws and drills for source control and IaC, but that builder's spirit remains. In this blog, I'll share lessons from my unusual path along with stories of projects that have let me blend woodwork with systems administration and coding. Whether you're a fellow boatlover or just curious, I hope you find some unexpected perspectives on achieving reliability through years of learning just-in-time engineering. Welcome aboard!

    /*<p>O cosmic berther of all radiance and vibration.
      Soften the ground of our being, and carve out within us a space were your presence can abide.
      Fill us with your creativity so that we may be empowered 
      To bare the fruit of your mission.
      Let each of our actions bare fruit in accordance to our desires.
      Endow us with wisdom to produce and share what each being needs to grow and flourish.
      Untie the tangled threads of destiny that bind us.
      As we release others of the entanglment of past mistakes.
      Do not let us be seduced by that which will divert us from our true purpose.
      But illuminate the opportunitites of the present moment.
      For you are the ground, and the fruitfull vision.
      The birth the power, and fullfilment
      As all is gathered and made whole once again
      And so it is!?/bin/bash
