    <p>After spending over 10 years, and counting, as a yacht carpenter honing my craft.
      I've embarked on an exciting career shift into the world of devops, and software devolopment. 
      Though worlds apart, I've found that many of the same principles that lead to high-quality boatbuilding. 
      Continuous improvement, automation, and modular architectures, also enable scaling and resilience in complex software systems. 
      My journey from physical to digital construction has been fueled by a passion for optimization, and capability building.

      Just as I iterated, wooden hull designs, implementing old & new world craftmanship, and techniques to improve structural integrity. 
      All while keeping the vessel light, fast, and maneuverable. Now get applied to infrastructures and deployment pipelines. 
      I may have traded routers, tablesaws and hand-planers for Bash, shell-scripting, and version source control......
      
       Still, that builder's spirit remains.

        In this blog, I'll share lessons from my unusual path. 
        Along with stories of projects that have let me blend highend vessel fabrication, with systems administration, and coding. 
        Whether you're a maritime enthusiast, carreer flip guru, fan of the underdog, or just curious.
        I hope you find some unexpected perspectives on achieving reliability through years of learning, and just in time engineering.
