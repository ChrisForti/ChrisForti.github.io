    <p>After spending over 10 years as a boatbuilder honing my craft.
      I've embarked on an exciting career shift into the world of devops, and software devolopment. 
      Though worlds apart, I've found that many of the same principles that lead to high-quality boatbuilding. 
      Continuous improvement, automation, and modular architectures, also enable scaling and resilience in complex software systems. 
      My journey from physical to digital construction has been fueled by a passion for optimization, and capability building.

     <p>Just as I iterated wooden hull designs and experimenting with techniques to improve structural integrity. 
      Now get applied to infrastructures and deployment pipelines. 
      I may have traded saws and drills for Bash, and VSC, but that builder's spirit remains.

      <p>In this blog, I'll share lessons from my unusual path. 
        Along with stories of projects that have let me blend highend vessel fabrication, with systems administration, and coding. 
        Whether you're a maritime enthusiast, carreer flip guru, fan of the underdog, or just curious.
        I hope you find some unexpected perspectives on achieving reliability through years of learning, and just in time engineering. </p>
