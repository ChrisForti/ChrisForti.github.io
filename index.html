    <p>After spending over 20 years as a boatbuilder honing my craft, and designing seaworthy vessels.
      I've embarked on an exciting career shift into the world of devops. 
      Though worlds apart, I've found that many of the same principles that lead to high-quality boatbuilding. 
      Continuous improvement, automation, and modular architectures, also enable scaling and resilience in complex software systems. 
      My journey from physical to digital construction has been fueled by a passion for optimization, and capability building.

     <p>Just as I iterated wooden hull designs and experimenting with techniques to improve structural integrity. 
      Now get applied to infrastructures and deployment pipelines. 
      I may have traded saws and drills for Bash, and VSC, but that builder's spirit remains.
